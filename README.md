## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- 

### What I learned

- Being able to use the live scss compiler and watched how my SASS stylings were transformed into 
css.
- I was able to accurately place object on web page using css grid, raltiv, blocks positioning systems.
- Designing a responsive web with HTMl5, SCSS and CSS using the VS Code code editor.
- I learnt to use images responsively through the @media query and both display-block and display-none. I added tow images in my html file but used them responsively.
- i was able to declare variables in SASS and called them in the body of my stylings.

```html
 <img id="product-img1" src="product-preview-card-component-main\images\image-product-desktop.jpg" alt="product-img">
 <img id="product-img2" src="product-preview-card-component-main\images\image-product-mobile.jpg" alt="product-img">
```

```css



@media only screen and (max-width: 555px) {
    body { 
        font-size: 0.78em;........and so on!

$Dark-cyan: hsl(158, 36%, 37%);
$cream: hsl(30, 38%, 92%);
```

### Continued development

in my next dev. project I want to build  more challenging project to include JavaScript in
